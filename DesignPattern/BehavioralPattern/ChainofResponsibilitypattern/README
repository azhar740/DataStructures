The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled. This pattern decouples the sender of the request from its receivers, giving more flexibility in assigning responsibilities to objects.

### Simple Explanation:

Imagine a customer service system where requests need to be handled by different levels of support: front-line support, technical support, and manager support. Instead of a single object handling all requests, each level of support is a handler that can either process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

### Key Components:

1. *Handler*: Defines an interface for handling requests and optionally setting the next handler in the chain.
2. *ConcreteHandler*: Implements the Handler interface and processes the requests it is responsible for. It can forward the request to the next handler if it can't handle it.
3. *Client*: Initiates the request and sends it to the first handler in the chain.

### Example:

Let's create an example of a customer service system.
