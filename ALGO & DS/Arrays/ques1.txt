In a cloud system there is a critical resource, a which can support only N connection requests at any time.
If there are more requests to the resource then all connections are degraded.
There are M callers which can use the resource, and M > N.
Implement a locking mechanism so that the callers can safely access the resource.
You have a SQL DB accessible to all M nodes which all M nodes can access anytime.



Signatures of the methods required:
bool AcquireLock();
Return value - True, lock acquired
- False, lock rejected
void ReleaseLock();



Addition of any more cloud service or component is not allowed in the scenario.



In each machine M, the code getting executed invokes AcquireLock, if it is successful it does the work
it needs to do with the resource and then releases the lock.
If the lock is unsuccessful, it will wait for 1 hour to try again.
