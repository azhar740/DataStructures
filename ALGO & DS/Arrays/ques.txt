o Say a file system gives the following methods:



void createFile(string name, int size);
// The space is reserved for the file and the file is filled with random data



void deleteFile(string name);
// Deletes all fragments for the file



string[] getFilenames(void);
// Array for all files's names on the volume



int getFreeSize(void);
// Sum of all free size spaces on the volume



File system will start placing the file in the free space which is just larger or equal than the file size.
File system can divide the file further into multiple fragments (parts) if the largest free space is not large enough for the file to be created.



Now create a program to create a file with maximum possible number of fragments (parts).
Existing files on the volume need not be preserved. You can manipulate the volume using the above methods anyway you want.
Implement the method.



string CreateFileWithMaxFragments(void);
// returns the file with largest number of fragments for the given volume
