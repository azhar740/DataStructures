Interview 1:
*given a sorted doubly circular link list insert an element in such a way that resulting list will be sorted.

*Networkig qustion
What is TCP zero window, tcp sliding window
*What are the loadbalancing methods apart from round robins
*Consistent hashing
*what is the system call, why it is required.


Interview 2:
*Given an array find the number of peaks e.g. 1 2 3 2 1 4 5 6 4 5
number of peaks in a above array are 2

*how consistent hashing ensures that requests will map unimormly on the circle.

*how gdb are able to access the process address space since os concept is, one process can access the other process address
space.


Interview 3:
*Multithreading: write a program in which one thread print the even numbers and the second print the odd numbers.
*How you will implement set and get method for LRU cache what data structure you will use. Cant we use hashing instead of map in c++.

Interview 4:
*Related to projects in Riverbed technology.
what is qos(quality of service, SNCF project), for what purpose we send system logs to another server(rsyslog feature, send logs using tcp, ssh instead of udp)
what type of logs are there in system logs

*Smart pointer concept 
Implement smart pointer in C++, unique pointer, shared pointer.
